# Kids Fruit Memory
Memory game for kids! Click a fruit to earn points, but don't click on any more than once! 
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. If the user can memorize all 12 fruits by clicking them only once, he/she wins the game!
